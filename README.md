Allows you to set unlimited breath, leg, and hand stamina, adjust all stamina values by a relative percentage, or manually set the values yourself.

To install:

1. Uncompress the contents of the download into the `./user/mods/` directory.
2. Open the `CustomStamina/config/config.json` file to adjust raid time options.
3. Leave a review and let me know what you think.

Enjoy.
